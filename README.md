# sms-spam-detection-using-rnn

Implementation of RNN Keras with LTSM on detecting spam sms messages

### Prerequisites

* Keras
* Tensorflow


## Observation
Currently 87% spam prediction. Modified the dataset by multiplying every spam sample by 50 since the spam sample count is low. This allows me to balance the data and improve model accuracy.


## Built With

* [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras) - Deep Learning Framework 

## Authors

* **Jonver Oro** - *Initial work* - [jonveroro](https://github.com/jonveroro)

## Dataset

* (SMS Spam Collection Dataset)(https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)
